1. The iPhone project was originally created using Xcode 3.X. 
However 4.X has github integrated in it, so I ported the 
project to Xcode 4.X. I am not sure if you can still open the 
project with 3.X or not, but I would not recommend it.
(Unfortunately Xcode 4.X does require OS Lionâ€¦)

2. Open the project by double clicking "GuessThatFriend.xcodeproj".
The project directory seems messy, but that's just how Xcode works, 
the project is organized if you open it with Xcode.
